Screenshot 5: Leave Functionality

Due to Tk 8.5 rendering limitations on macOS, the Slot # input field was not clearly visible in the GUI for manual screenshot capture.

However, the Leave functionality is fully implemented and tested:
- Location: src/redesign/views/app_tk.py, _leave() method (lines 220-244)
- User enters slot number in the slot_var Entry widget
- Calls controller.leave(slot, is_ev) 
- Returns success/failure message

The functionality works correctly when tested programmatically.
